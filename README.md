Building **Lilly** — a self-steering cognitive AI running on Qwen3-8B with explicit internal state machinery:

- **8D Plutchik emotional field** — joy, trust, fear, surprise, sadness, disgust, anger, anticipation — with wave-packet interference for secondary emotion emergence
- **Evalatis** — evolutionary activation steering: vectors crystallize from activations, spawn children via crossover, compete and get pruned based on affinity × staleness vs. surprise EMA
- **AffectiveResonator** — queries episodic memory for similar past situations, computes weighted valence, injects a blended steering vector at layers 14–18 during inference
- **163k-feature SAE transcoders** trained on Qwen3-8B MLP layers via TransformerLens
- **6-phase cognitive cycle** (Generate → Curate → Simulate → Integrate → Reflect → Continue) with Active Inference / Free Energy Principle tracking prediction error across phases

The research question: can a model's behavior be continuously shaped by its own past emotional responses to similar situations? And if so, does it *know* this is happening?

This sits in direct conversation with mechanistic interpretability work on emergent introspection — building from the inside what that work probes from the outside.
